    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is <em>Julien Tsang</em> in the interactive media design program at <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr>.
        I am chinese but I was born here in <em>Ottawa</em> on December 28<sup>th</sup> 2003. My parents were born in Vietnam but
        they had to flee the vietnam war to Canada in the 80s. They are currently in <em>China</em> because my mom is a diplomat. 
    </p>
    <p>In my free time I like to go rock climbing (bouldering specifically) and I enjoy going outside 
        to take pictures with my camera. Fun fact about me:  I lived in <em>Mexico City</em> from 2015 to 2019 
        and I can speak spanish which is my 4<sup>th</sup> language after cantonese, english and french.
    </p>
